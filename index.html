    <h2>Begins here</h2>
    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p>Thanks to perscholas i now have the opportunity to learn software engineering. I am very proud to be taking part in the Ny software engineering cohort. Additionally i am currently studying both in class and during my off time. Because software engineering is very complex i have dedicated every moment i possibly can to being prepared for being employable as a Software engineer.</p>
    <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    <p>I am super excited to work with the other people in my software engineering cohort. I plan to try my hardest to reach out to as many of my cohort peers as i can. I realize that learning programming is hard and it can be even more difficult when you do not make yourself available to meet others they may have different levels of competency and experience which ultimately can help with my ultimate goal of being employable as a software engineer.</p>

    <p>Here are 5 things i will learn at perscholas</p>
